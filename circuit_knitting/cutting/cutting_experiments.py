    Generate cutting subexperiments and their associated coefficients.

    If the input, ``circuits``, is a :class:`QuantumCircuit` instance, the
    output subexperiments will be contained within a 1D array, and ``observables`` is
    expected to be a :class:`PauliList` instance.

    If the input circuit and observables are specified by dictionaries with partition labels
    as keys, the output subexperiments will be returned as a dictionary which maps each
    partition label to a 1D array containing the subexperiments associated with that partition.

    In both cases, the subexperiment lists are ordered as follows:

        :math:`[sample_{0}observable_{0}, \ldots, sample_{0}observable_{N}, sample_{1}observable_{0}, \ldots, sample_{M}observable_{N}]`

    The coefficients will always be returned as a 1D array -- one coefficient for each unique sample.

    Args:
        circuits: The circuit(s) to partition and separate
        observables: The observable(s) to evaluate for each unique sample
        num_samples: The number of samples to draw from the quasi-probability distribution. If set
            to infinity, the weights will be generated rigorously rather than by sampling from
            the distribution.
    Returns:
        A tuple containing the cutting experiments and their associated coefficients.
        If the input circuits is a :class:`QuantumCircuit` instance, the output subexperiments
        will be a sequence of circuits -- one for every unique sample and observable. If the
        input circuits are represented as a dictionary keyed by partition labels, the output
        subexperiments will also be a dictionary keyed by partition labels and containing
        the subexperiments for each partition.
        The coefficients are always a sequence of length-2 tuples, where each tuple contains the
        coefficient and the :class:`WeightType`. Each coefficient corresponds to one unique sample.

    Raises:
        ValueError: ``num_samples`` must be at least one.
        ValueError: ``circuits`` and ``observables`` are incompatible types
        ValueError: :class:`SingleQubitQPDGate` instances must have their cut ID
            appended to the gate label so they may be associated with other gates belonging
            to the same cut.
        ValueError: :class:`SingleQubitQPDGate` instances are not allowed in unseparated circuits.
